1.The purpose of this software is to learn how to use java script, html, and CSS

2. My name is Abdaljabbar Hersi and I developed this on June 24 2021.

3. Design choices
	-When a person submits his order a prompt comes up making sure they truly want it if so the page 
	will reload and you can start the processes again.
	- I also fixed the first column containing the minimum order, delivery charge, and my hyper links so that 
	when you scroll down the menu it is always visible.
	- Also I design choice to make the user select a restaurant rather automatically have a restaurant be 
	on display onload.
